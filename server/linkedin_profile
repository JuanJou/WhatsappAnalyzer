I'm a software engineer with 5 years of experience working in the industry. My roles have gone from a front-end developer in the yearly days of my career, to an software engineer part of an AI team that helps the company to leverage ML models to have an impact on day-to-day operations and business value.

My main focus has been the creation of dashboards to monitor ML models (including front-end, back-end and infrastructure development) and pipelines to retrain and test production models in order to improve its performance using the most valuable asset in today's world, data.

My academic background has provided me a perspective on the whole software project lifecycle, as well as,  strong technical and mathematical skills that I continue to grow through courses, articles and papers.
